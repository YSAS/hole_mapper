-------------------------
Using hole_mapper code. 
-------------------------
There are two programs: plateplanner.py and platemapper.py

plateplanner.py is for designing plates and generates the .plate files. It is described here.

platemapper.py is used to generate fiber assignments for plates and is discussed elsewhere.

Execution is (in dir of plateplanner.py): "plateplanner.py", but running the program prior to the following steps is pointless.


-------------------------
Creating plates
-------------------------
go through all the received files and fix formatting errors or yell at submitter
Some common issues:
abbreviated required column names
RA2000 DE2000 instead of RA, Dec, & epoch columns 
extension not .field
# in front of header row
no field=name
<> around a number value

Create a directory with all of the .field files, and make an archive of your starting point.


Figure out what UT each field should be drilled for and add the line
obsdate = yyyy mm dd h m s

run plateplanner.py: ./plateplanner.py
