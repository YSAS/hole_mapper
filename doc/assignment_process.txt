_assign_fibers outline

for each setup being assigned
	get all things from each setup which need a science fiber on them
	gather their positions and conflict diameters
	gather their weights, normalizing each so it is from 0 - 1 with 1 	being the max priority target (T) in the field

	create a collisions graph of the targets thats can't be plugged simultaneously and cut out the weighted minimum vertex cover
	add whatever is left over to a bot of things needing science fibers

get the positions and field-normalized priorities of of the targets
flag any with its maximum field priority as uncuttable if mustkeep is set
flag any in a field with keepall set as uncuttable

create a collision graph and try to cut the weighted minimum vertex cover given uncuttable
if failure assignment impossible

reset any previous assignments for the setups involved

gather all skys and objects that don't have assignments (i.e. user specified fibers from a fiber column)

Assign all the things preset assignments to their cassette, failing if multiple things are set to the same fiber

for each pool of possible assignments (all fibers if any setup is going to both

determine how many more objects (T & S) there are that need fibers than there are fibers available. divide this by the number of setups to get the number of targets that are dropped from each setup. Do this separately for r & b arms if setup assignments are to be confined to one arm or the other.
This penalizes each field with an equal number of losses, it probably should penalize in proportion to each setup's contribution to the total number of targets


Now drop skys from each setup until none are left, the minsky limit is hit, or the number to be dropped from that setup is reached. Drop lower priority skys first.

If there are still too many things left do the same with targets for each setup, respecting priorities, skipping anything with max priority if mustkeep is set. Fail if the needed number to be dropped from a setup can't be dropped.
